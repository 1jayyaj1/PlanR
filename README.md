# Umba

## Quick set up

First make sure you have mongodb installed and running, you can follow the steps here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/

You will also need to have *Node.js* installed (https://nodejs.org/en/).

We use *Express.js* as our backend. In order to start the server, do this:

```
cd Umba/server
npm install
PORT=3001 node bin/www
```

As for the frontend, we use *React* (duh!). To get started, run this:

```
cd Umba/client
npm install
npm start
```
