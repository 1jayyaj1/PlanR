## Installation

First make sure you have MongoDB installed and running, you can follow the steps here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/

You will also need to have *Node.js* installed (https://nodejs.org/en/).

We use *Express.js* as our back-end. In order to start the server, do this:

```
cd PlanR/server
npm install
npm start
```

As for the front-end, we use *ReactJS*. To get started, run this:

```
cd PlanR/client
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

We took care of writing extensive documentation (available in this repository) that give more details on how to use PlanR.


<a name="improv"></a>
## Future Improvements

Again, the documentation (available in this repository) lists multiple future improvements that could be done to improve the user experience.
